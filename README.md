# Pi Approximator in Processing

This project serves as a simple demonstration in Processing to approximate the value of Pi using a Monte Carlo method.

## About

This Processing sketch utilizes a Monte Carlo algorithm to estimate the value of Pi. It generates random points within a square and determines the ratio of points falling inside a quarter-circle inscribed within the square to the total points generated. By leveraging this ratio, an approximation of Pi can be obtained.

## Getting Started

To run this project, ensure you have [Processing](https://processing.org/download/) installed on your machine.

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the `pi_approximator.pde` file using Processing.
3. Click the "Run" button within the Processing IDE to execute the sketch.

## Learnings

This project is created as part of a test project to learn Processing. It offers insights into:

- Implementing Monte Carlo methods in Processing.
- Visualizing random point generation and its relation to Pi approximation.
